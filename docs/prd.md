# Gachimuchi GIF Wall Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**

- Create a focused web application for straight men to browse "gachimuchi" GIFs
- Provide infinite scrolling experience for continuous browsing
- Deliver a simple, distraction-free interface
- Deploy on Vercel for easy access

**Background Context:**
This is a niche web application designed for straight men who want to browse "gachimuchi" GIFs through the Tenor API. The application will provide a focused, infinite-scrolling experience that supports the intended use case. The app will query the Tenor API for "gachimuchi" GIFs and display them in a wall layout with infinite scrolling functionality.

- NFR4: Deploy on Vercel with minimal configuration

## User Interface Design Goals

**Overall UX Vision:**
Minimal, distraction-free interface focused entirely on displaying GIFs in an infinite scrolling wall. Dark theme with masculine aesthetic.

**Key Interaction Paradigms:**

- Infinite scroll for continuous browsing
- Responsive grid layout
- Click to view full size
- Minimal navigation

**Core Screens and Views:**

- Main GIF Wall (primary interface)
- Full-size GIF view (modal/overlay)

**Accessibility: WCAG AA**

- Keyboard navigation support
- Alt text for GIFs
- Screen reader compatibility

**Branding:**

- Dark theme with minimal, masculine aesthetic
- No logos or branding elements
- Focus on content over design

**Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**

- Desktop and mobile responsive
- Touch-friendly interactions

## Technical Assumptions

**Repository Structure: Monorepo**

- Single repository for frontend and deployment configuration
- Simple structure for single-purpose application

**Service Architecture:**

- Frontend-only application using Tenor API
- No backend services required
- Client-side API calls with CORS handling

**Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration**

- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for API calls and infinite scroll
- No E2E tests needed for this scope

**Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests:**

- Use React with Next.js for Vercel deployment
- Implement infinite scroll with Intersection Observer API
- Use CSS Grid for responsive GIF wall layout
- Handle Tenor API rate limits and errors gracefully
- Implement lazy loading for performance
- Use TypeScript for type safety

## Epic List

**Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure**
Establish project setup, basic layout, and Tenor API integration.

**Epic 2: GIF Wall & Infinite Scrolling**
Implement the core GIF wall with infinite scrolling functionality.

**Epic 3: User Experience & Polish**
Add full-size viewing, error handling, and performance optimizations.

## Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:**
Establish project setup, basic layout, and Tenor API integration. This epic will deliver a working application that can fetch and display "gachimuchi" GIFs in a basic grid layout.

**Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic Structure**
As a developer,
I want to set up the Next.js project with TypeScript and basic structure,
so that I have a foundation for the GIF wall application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Next.js project created with TypeScript
2. Basic project structure with components, pages, and utilities folders
3. ESLint and Prettier configured
4. Vercel deployment configuration added
5. Basic layout component with dark theme styling
6. Project builds and deploys successfully to Vercel

**Story 1.2: Tenor API Integration**
As a developer,
I want to integrate with the Tenor API to fetch "gachimuchi" GIFs,
so that I can display real GIF data in the application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Tenor API client function created with proper error handling
2. API call to fetch "gachimuchi" GIFs with limit=8 parameter
3. TypeScript interfaces defined for API response
4. Error handling for API failures and rate limits
5. Loading states implemented for API calls
6. API integration tested with mock data

**Story 1.3: Basic GIF Display Grid**
As a user,
I want to see "gachimuchi" GIFs displayed in a responsive grid,
so that I can browse the available content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Responsive CSS Grid layout for GIF display
2. GIF components render with proper aspect ratios
3. Dark theme styling applied consistently
4. Mobile-responsive design (2 columns mobile, 3+ desktop)
5. Basic loading and error states displayed
6. GIFs load and display correctly from Tenor API

## Epic 2: GIF Wall & Infinite Scrolling

**Epic Goal:**
Implement infinite scrolling to load more GIFs as the user scrolls, creating a continuous browsing experience.

**Story 2.1: Infinite Scroll Implementation**
As a user,
I want to automatically load more GIFs as I scroll down,
so that I can browse continuously without manual pagination.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Intersection Observer API implemented for scroll detection
2. Automatic API calls triggered when user reaches bottom
3. New GIFs appended to existing grid without page refresh
4. Loading indicator shown during fetch operations
5. Scroll position maintained during new content loading
6. Performance optimized to prevent excessive API calls

**Story 2.2: Scroll Performance Optimization**
As a user,
I want smooth scrolling performance even with many GIFs loaded,
so that the browsing experience remains responsive.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Lazy loading implemented for GIF images
2. Virtual scrolling or pagination for large datasets
3. Memory management to prevent browser slowdown
4. Smooth scroll behavior without jank
5. Performance monitoring and optimization
6. Graceful handling of memory constraints

## Epic 3: User Experience & Polish

**Epic Goal:**
Add full-size viewing, error handling, and performance optimizations to complete the user experience.

**Story 3.1: Full-Size GIF Viewing**
As a user,
I want to click on a GIF to view it in full size,
so that I can see the details clearly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Click handler added to each GIF in the grid
2. Modal or overlay component for full-size display
3. Close functionality (click outside, escape key, close button)
4. Full-size GIF loads with proper aspect ratio
5. Smooth transition animations for modal open/close
6. Mobile-friendly touch interactions

**Story 3.2: Error Handling and Edge Cases**
As a user,
I want the app to handle errors gracefully,
so that I can continue browsing even when issues occur.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Network error handling with retry mechanisms
2. API rate limit handling with appropriate messaging
3. Empty state handling when no GIFs are found
4. Offline state detection and messaging
