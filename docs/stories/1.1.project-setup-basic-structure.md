### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for any utility functions created [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-tests]
- Component tests for layout components [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-component-test]
- Test files should be in `src/__tests__/` directory [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
