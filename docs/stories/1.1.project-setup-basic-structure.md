### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for any utility functions created [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-tests]
- Component tests for layout components [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-component-test]
- Test files should be in `src/__tests__/` directory [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- Use Jest + React Testing Library for component testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-testing]

### Technical Constraints

- Next.js 15.1.8 with TypeScript 5.9.2 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Tailwind CSS 4.0 for styling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#css-framework]

- Vercel for deployment [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#iac-tool]
- App Router structure (not Pages Router) [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing

- **Test File Location**: `src/__tests__/` directory [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- **Testing Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-testing]
- **Test Standards**:
