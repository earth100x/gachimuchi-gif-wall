# Epic 2: GIF Wall & Infinite Scrolling

**Epic Goal:**
Implement infinite scrolling to load more GIFs as the user scrolls, creating a continuous browsing experience.

**Story 2.1: Infinite Scroll Implementation**
As a user,
I want to automatically load more GIFs as I scroll down,
so that I can browse continuously without manual pagination.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Intersection Observer API implemented for scroll detection
2. Automatic API calls triggered when user reaches bottom
3. New GIFs appended to existing grid without page refresh
4. Loading indicator shown during fetch operations
5. Scroll position maintained during new content loading
6. Performance optimized to prevent excessive API calls

**Story 2.2: Scroll Performance Optimization**
As a user,
I want smooth scrolling performance even with many GIFs loaded,
so that the browsing experience remains responsive.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Lazy loading implemented for GIF images
2. Virtual scrolling or pagination for large datasets
3. Memory management to prevent browser slowdown
4. Smooth scroll behavior without jank
5. Performance monitoring and optimization
6. Graceful handling of memory constraints
