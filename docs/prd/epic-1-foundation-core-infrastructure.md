# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:**
Establish project setup, basic layout, and Tenor API integration. This epic will deliver a working application that can fetch and display "gachimuchi" GIFs in a basic grid layout.

**Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic Structure**
As a developer,
I want to set up the Next.js project with TypeScript and basic structure,
so that I have a foundation for the GIF wall application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Next.js project created with TypeScript
2. Basic project structure with components, pages, and utilities folders
3. ESLint and Prettier configured
4. Vercel deployment configuration added
5. Basic layout component with dark theme styling
6. Project builds and deploys successfully to Vercel

**Story 1.2: Tenor API Integration**
As a developer,
I want to integrate with the Tenor API to fetch "gachimuchi" GIFs,
so that I can display real GIF data in the application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Tenor API client function created with proper error handling
2. API call to fetch "gachimuchi" GIFs with limit=8 parameter
3. TypeScript interfaces defined for API response
4. Error handling for API failures and rate limits
5. Loading states implemented for API calls
6. API integration tested with mock data

**Story 1.3: Basic GIF Display Grid**
As a user,
I want to see "gachimuchi" GIFs displayed in a responsive grid,
so that I can browse the available content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Responsive CSS Grid layout for GIF display
2. GIF components render with proper aspect ratios
3. Dark theme styling applied consistently
4. Mobile-responsive design (2 columns mobile, 3+ desktop)
5. Basic loading and error states displayed
6. GIFs load and display correctly from Tenor API
