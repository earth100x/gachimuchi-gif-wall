  - Given: Mock trending API response
  - When: getTrending method is called
  - Then: Trending GIFs are properly loaded and state is updated

### Critical Gaps

None identified - all acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage.

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive coverage analysis:

1. **Current Coverage**: Excellent - all 6 acceptance criteria have full test coverage
2. **Test Types**: Well-balanced mix of unit, integration, and hook tests
3. **Mock Strategy**: Effective use of mock data that matches real API structure
4. **Error Scenarios**: Comprehensive coverage of error conditions and edge cases

### Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: All requirements have full test coverage
- **No Gaps**: Every acceptance criterion is validated by multiple test scenarios
- **Quality Assurance**: Tests cover both happy path and error scenarios

### Traceability Best Practices Applied

- **Given-When-Then Documentation**: Each test mapping clearly describes the scenario
- **Coverage Verification**: Every acceptance criterion mapped to specific tests
- **Test Level Appropriateness**: Unit tests for logic, integration tests for API flow
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Error scenarios and boundary conditions tested

### Integration with Quality Gates

This traceability analysis supports the PASS gate decision by demonstrating:

- **Complete Coverage**: 100% of acceptance criteria have test validation
- **Quality Assurance**: Tests cover both functional and non-functional requirements
- **Risk Mitigation**: Error scenarios and edge cases are thoroughly tested
- **Maintainability**: Clear mapping between requirements and tests enables future updates
