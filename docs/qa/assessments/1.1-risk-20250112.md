## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                            | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | TypeScript configuration conflicts     | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Medium Risk Tests

- **Build Process Testing**: Verify TypeScript compilation and Tailwind CSS processing
- **Configuration Validation**: Test ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configurations
- **Component Rendering**: Test layout components with dark theme styling

### Priority 2: Low Risk Tests

- **Deployment Verification**: Test Vercel deployment process
- **Development Workflow**: Verify local development server functionality

### Priority 3: Standard Tests

- **Basic Functionality**: Test that all acceptance criteria are met
- **Code Quality**: Verify linting and formatting work correctly

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9) - None identified
- High risks affecting security/data - None identified

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- Configuration risks are acceptable for initial setup
- Deployment risks are mitigated through testing

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Build success rates for TECH risks
- Deployment success rates for OPS risks
- Development environment stability

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- TypeScript or Tailwind CSS versions change
- Vercel deployment process changes
- Development workflow modifications
- New dependencies added

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### TECH-001: TypeScript Configuration Conflicts

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - TypeScript 5.9.2 with Next.js 15.1.8 may have compatibility issues
**Impact**: Medium - Could cause build failures or development issues
**Mitigation**:

- Use Next.js recommended TypeScript configuration
- Test build process thoroughly
- Monitor for TypeScript errors during development

**Testing Focus**:

- Verify TypeScript compilation in build process
- Test type checking in development mode
- Validate tsconfig.json settings

### TECH-002: Tailwind CSS 4.0 Compatibility Issues

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Tailwind CSS 4.0 is relatively new and may have compatibility issues
**Impact**: Medium - Could affect styling and component rendering
**Mitigation**:

- Use stable Tailwind CSS configuration
- Test component rendering with dark theme
- Have fallback styling approach ready

**Testing Focus**:

- Test component rendering with Tailwind classes
- Verify dark theme implementation
- Test responsive design functionality

### OPS-001: Vercel Deployment Configuration Errors

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Vercel has good Next.js support
**Impact**: Medium - Could prevent successful deployment
**Mitigation**:

- Follow Vercel Next.js deployment guidelines
- Test deployment process locally
- Verify vercel.json configuration

**Testing Focus**:

- Test local build process
- Verify vercel.json configuration
- Test deployment to staging environment if available

### OPS-002: Development Environment Setup Failures

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Standard Next.js setup is well-documented
**Impact**: Medium - Could delay development progress
**Mitigation**:

- Follow Next.js setup documentation
- Test development server functionality
- Verify all dependencies install correctly

**Testing Focus**:

- Test `npm run dev` command
- Verify development server starts correctly
- Test hot reload functionality
